            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            
                <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>
                <h2>The first version</h2>
                
                <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

                </picture>
                
                <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
                
                <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
                
                <p>The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                    <source media="(max-width:600 )" srcset="imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg">
                    <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Block, creator of Bugdroid">
                </picture>
                
                <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of Android.</p>
                
                <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="bugdroid">
                
                <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the restrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                    <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                    <lu>
                        <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>

                        <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>

                        <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                        <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                    </lu>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as <strong>Google</strong> decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
                        Access the Android History website <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_nz/history/" target="_blank" class="external">here</a> to learn about the sequence of "sweetened" versions and what each one brought to the Android system.
